# User and Time-registration System
## Hobby Project

### **_Introduction_**
During the 7+2 months C# bootcamp course, I have learned a lot and I wanted to practice more. Luckily it was easy to find a hobby project - we use timeregistration at work, which works fine, but I was thinking to make my own as well :) 

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. C#
2. MySQL

## **_The project itself_**
Admin can add, delete and update users basic information, projects, departments and employment types. A user can update its own information, choose favorite project and add, update the spent time on a given project.

As a user, you can see the history about how you spent your time and see some graphical statistics as well. The spent time can be changed, even after saved in the databse, however the fact that it was changed is also saved.

As as Admin, you can see history and visual statistics about a given projects.

**Aim of the Project**

The main objective of this project was to create an easy time-registration system, where the user can change detailes, easily see overwork hours and visually see which project used most of his/her time. 
 column. This design choice allows for a more flexible and scalable system (hopefully).

 ## **_Future prospectives_**
 Update codebase to .Net MAUI whic means it can be used as desktop application but also as a mobile app and web app.

## **_What have I learned_**
1. Tons of OOP approach
2. Database structure
3. C#
4. MySQL
